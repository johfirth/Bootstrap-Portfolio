                                My name is John Firth, I am currently a Sr. Cloud Infrastructure Engineer, 
                                I am attending a bootcamp to learn full stack web development. My skills include putting a lot
                                of things into this to demonstrate that I can make a float work. Watching a lot of netflix, and HBOGO,
                                and building websites that look a little better than a 5 year old.
                                I also like to watch internet videos of cats, and making this much filler about yourself is actually hard. 
                                I have been to a few conferences and build servers for most of my job. When I complete this course I hope
                                to be better at coding and be able to actually make a fully functioning website.
                                That does more than just flexbox and filler. I have to keep typing and putting items
                                into this so that it will wrap around the picture. I am assuming that no one is reading this
                                at this point, because it has just been me talking about cats. Oh, and I love baseball, 
                                I love going to baseball and hockey games.
